# BLDC_6_STEP_CONTROL
Study of the 6-step control method for controlling BLDC motors

## Overview
This repository documents my study of the 6-step control method for BLDC motors, with video explanations of how the motor is driven.

## How to Drive a BLDC Motor

### Basic Concept
BLDC motors have three phases (A, B, C) that need to be energized in a specific sequence to make the motor spin. The 6-step method drives the motor by switching which phases are powered in six sequential steps.

### The 6-Step Sequence
Each electrical cycle is divided into six steps. At each step, two phases are energized:

- Step 1: A+ B-
- Step 2: A+ C-
- Step 3: B+ C-
- Step 4: B+ A-
- Step 5: C+ A-
- Step 6: C+ B-

This sequence repeats continuously to keep the motor rotating.

### How to Record Videos
1. Prepare slides or diagrams showing the 6-step sequence
2. Record using screen capture software (OBS, Camtasia, etc.)
3. Upload to YouTube or your preferred platform
4. Add the link above

## What to Explain in Videos

When recording videos, focus on:
- The 6-step commutation sequence
- How energizing different phase combinations makes the motor rotate
- Why the sequence needs to be in the correct order
